# User search page

## Topic

a small coding challenge for fullstack developer position

## Requirments
1. By the time the page loads we want to populate the results list
with 25 user entries. The last item must be an option with the
legend “More results...” that will request another 25 entries and
append them to the list.

2. On top of the search list, we need a free text input that will filter
the current results by the user First name or Last name field. We
also want to be able to filter by their gender. The Api only handles
“male” and “female” as possible genders.

3. On the results list each user entry should display their name,
email information and a thumbnail picture of them. The name and
last name must have their first letter capitalized.

4. When clicking one of the user entries the detailed information
should be displayed on the screen. We want to see the user id,
location and contact information along with their picture.
